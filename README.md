# Short course on Parametric Survival Analysis

This repository contains the materials associated to my short course on parametric models for the analysis of survival data. The material covers parametric models for Overall and Relative survival, as well as several software tools to implement these sorts of models.

Course length: 3-4 hours.

##  Survival Analysis: Parametric Models

The slides for Lecture I can be found at [Lecture I](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TOTOyIgBMOmTmweqkLvARrYyONp88Hu7/view?usp=share_link).


Tha aims of this lecture are:

- To describe the aims of survival analysis (overall survival).
- To describe parametric approaches to estimate the survival function.
- To describe two regression models: PH and AFT.
- To present software tools for survival analysis and a real data example.
- To discuss other parametric, semiparametric and non parametric alternatives.

##  Net Survival Analysis: Parametric Models

The aims of this lecture are:

- To introduce the relative survival framework.
- To introduce a general hazard structure.
- To present an application in cancer epidemiology.
- To discuss a challenge in the relative survival framework.
